The efficacy of anti-cancer therapies is severely limited by the emergence of drug resistance. 
While genetic drivers are well-characterized, growing evidence suggests that non-genetic mechanisms, 
particularly those involving drug-tolerant persisters (DTPs), play a pivotal role in solid tumor relapse. 
To elucidate the evolutionary dynamics of DTP-induced resistance, this project develops a stochastic agent-based model (ABM) of 
solid tumor evolution that couples macroscopic population dynamics with microscopic epigenetic state inheritance during the cell cycle. 
Simulations can accurately reproduce the temporal progression of relapse observed in experimental studies, 
capturing the dynamic transition from sensitive cells to DTPs, and ultimately to stable resistant phenotypes under prolonged therapy.
